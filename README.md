The most advanced scam link filter bot for Discord, this bot is 100% open source under MIT Licence.

## ‚ú® Features

- Blocking scam links.
- Sending an embed with logs to the chosen channel.
- Buttons under the embed to ban the user. (Dyno button not available if Dyno is not on the server.)
- Whitelist button if the URL is safe but got banned.
- Role and channel whitelist.
- Using multiple databases and APIs of known scam links such as:
	- [discord-phishing-links](https://github.com/nikolaischunk/discord-phishing-links)

## üîß Installation

First of all, clone the GitHub project in your selected folder

    # Cloning the GitHub project
    git clone https://github.com/ArthixFR/noscam-bot.git

You should then be able to find the cloned project

    # Going in the bot directory
    cd noscam-bot
    
    # Displaying what's in the folder
    ls

If you want your bot running you'll need to change the config file with a ftp or the tool called nano. We'll use a ftp here.
Copy the file named `config.sample.js` to `config.js`

    # Copying a file and changing the name
    cp config.sample.js config.js

Then, open the file `config.js` with your ftp client by copying it on your PC or opening it remotely.

Search for the line `token: 'INSERT BOT TOKEN HERE'` and copy the bot token that you created on the Discord developper portal.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***Be careful, never provide you bot token to anyone who you don't trust!*** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Now, you'll need to install npm dependencies, without them the bot is not gonna be able to run.

	# Installing dependencies
	npm i

GG! The bot is ready to run on your server! Just type `node index.js` in your Linux terminal to run the bot. But if you leave the terminal page your bot will shutdown so we need to setup a background run for the bot.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Post installation

### Background running

Like said earlier, there's two methods for running the bot in background, Screen and pm2. We'll see in this part how to use Screen and pm2 with the bot.

### Screen method

The first option is screen, this tool is letting you running your script or other program in the background with virtual screens, it's literally like running the with `node index.js` but this time, if you leave the window, the bot will continue to run.

If it's not already the case, install Screen on your system

    # installing screen
    sudo apt-get install screen

Once done, check if it's properly installed

    # Checking Screen version
    screen -v

It should return something like that

    Screen version 4.08.00 (GNU) 05-Feb-20

Now type the following command to make your file executable

    # Making your file executable
    chmod +x start.sh

Now, we can start the bot with Screen!

	# Starting the bot with Screen
    ./start.sh

The terminal should return `Bot started!`
GG! Your bot is now running in the background! To access the virtual screen, you can type

    # Accessing the virtual screen
    screen -x noscam-bot

To leave the screen you can do the following command `CTRL A` and then `d`, to kill the screen do `CTRL A` and then `k` or just doing a `CTRL C` on the screen.

[Here's the full Screen documentation.](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html)

### pm2 method

We'll see here the pm2 method. pm2 is a powerful tool where you can monitor your bot usage in realtime but also managing it. (Restart, crash...)

First of all, you need to [create an account on pm2.](https://id.keymetrics.io/api/oauth/register)
Then, you should land on the bucket creation page. Call your bucket `noscam-bot`.

Follow the instructions on pm2 after the bucket creation.

	# Installing pm2 with NPM
	npm install pm2 -g
	
	# Linking pm2 to the bot
	pm2 link xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Now that you have linked you can initialize the bot config on pm2 with

	# Starting the bot for the first time
	pm2 start pm2.config.js

Now that you've started the config for the first time, all interactions with pm2 and the bot will be

	# Starting the bot
	pm2 start noscam-bot
	
	# Stopping the bot
	pm2 stop noscam-bot
	
	# Restarting the bot
	pm2 restart noscam-bot

GG Your bot is now running on pm2! You can access the virtual screen with `pm2 logs noscam-bot` you also can do `pm2 status` to see what's currently running.

Everything is also manageable on the pm2 website, [you can read the full doc here.](https://pm2.io/docs/plus/overview/)
