## ðŸ”§ Installation

First of all, clone the GitHub project in your selected folder

    # Cloning the GitHub project
    git clone https://github.com/ArthixFR/noscam-bot.git

You should then be able to find the cloned project

    # Going in the bot directory
    cd noscam-bot
    
    # Displaying what's in the folder
    ls

If you want your bot running you'll need to change the config file with a ftp or the tool called nano. We'll use a ftp here.
Copy the file named `config.sample.js` to `config.js`

    # Copying a file and change the name
    cp config.sample.js config.js
